We are developing the Distributed Loan Management System (DLMS) using UDP/IP and Corba. It has 3 integral parts
1.	Front end
2.	Sequencer
3.	Replica Manager
We have implemented the system to be either byzantine failure tolerant or highly available by selecting the feature when the server system is initialized.
